## Coronavirus Database System         									
Uses Python and MySQL
Uses web scraping to acquire the latest pandemic data from each country. 
The data is processed and then stored into a MySQL database. 
The database is updated every 24hrs. 
A UI allows the user to make use of the data (eg: transferring it to a CSV/ reporting various statistical measures etc.)

## Single server queue simulation   									
Used queuing theory to create a single server queue model and simulated it using Python 
The simulation will run and various queuing theory metrics will be 
reported or plotted (eg: the average delay faced by each customer over time) so that problems with the current model can be identified and its parameters can be tuned. 
Useful in modeling environments like food courts and boosting various performance metrics.  

## SIR epidemic simulation               	    							                
The SIR model is a simple mathematical model of epidemics. An epidemic is when the number of people infected with a disease is increasing in a population.
S, I, and R stand for: Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered.
A real time simulation was performed, with each the number of days mapped to a certain number of seconds.
A report was generated at the end
